1) Create a single line script that returns the number of httpd processes that are running on the
current machine

  ps -auxw | grep httpd | grep -v grep | wc -l

2) From the current folder (/tmp), provide some bash commands that will rename all the *.txt files in
mig33/inner_folder/ to *.dat

 for file in mig33/inner.folder/*.txt; do mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.dat"; done
